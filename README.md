This is a repository for [PEAR HTML_QuickForm2] package that has been migrated from [PEAR SVN].

HTML_QuickForm2 provides methods to create, validate and render HTML forms. It is a PHP5 rewrite of [PEAR HTML_QuickForm]
and related packages.

Features:

 * Supports all form elements defined in HTML4, provides several custom elements. Support for HTML5 form elements is
   planned.
 * Server-side and client-side validation, several common rules provided. Validation rules can be combined with
   'and' and 'or' for complex validation scenarios. Client-side validation can be run on changing the form field and
   on submitting the form.
 * Client-side validation and Javascript-backed elements use a small self-contained JS library, there is no
   dependency on JS frameworks.
 * Multipage forms (tabbed forms and wizards) are possible.
 * Pluggable elements, rules, renderers and renderer plugins.

Please report issues via the [PEAR bug tracker] or [Github issues].

Pull requests are welcome.

## Installation

The package may be installed either with PEAR

    $ pear install HTML_QuickForm2

or with composer

    $ composer require pear/html_quickform2

Since release 2.1 composer installation relies completely on autoloading and does not contain `require_once` calls or 
use `include-path` option.

## Basic usage

```PHP
require_once 'HTML/QuickForm2.php'; // Only when installed with PEAR

$form = new HTML_QuickForm2('tutorial');

// Set defaults for the form elements
$form->addDataSource(new HTML_QuickForm2_DataSource_Array([
    'name' => 'Joe User'
]));

// Add some elements to the form
$fieldset = $form->addElement('fieldset')->setLabel('QuickForm2 tutorial example');
$name = $fieldset->addElement('text', 'name', ['size' => 50, 'maxlength' => 255])
                 ->setLabel('Enter your name:');
$fieldset->addElement('submit', null, ['value' => 'Send!']);

// Define filters and validation rules
$name->addFilter('trim');
$name->addRule('required', 'Please enter your name');

// Try to validate a form
if ($form->validate()) {
    echo '<h1>Hello, ' . htmlspecialchars($name->getValue()) . '!</h1>';
    exit;
}

// Output the form
echo $form;
```
