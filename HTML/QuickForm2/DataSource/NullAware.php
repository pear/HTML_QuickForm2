/**
 * Interface for data sources that may contain explicit null values

 * getValue() was designed to return null for missing values, unfortunately that
 * led to bugs when data source contained values explicitly set to null,
 * see {@link http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=20295}. This interface defines
 * a method that may be used by elements to check whether a value is available,
 * even if that value is null.
