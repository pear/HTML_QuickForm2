/**
 * Rule for required elements
 *
 * The main difference from "nonempty" Rule is that
 * - elements to which this Rule is attached will be considered required
 *   ({@link HTML_QuickForm2_Node::isRequired()} will return true for them) and
 *   marked accordingly when outputting the form
 * - this Rule can only be added directly to the element and other Rules can
 *   only be added to it via and_() method
